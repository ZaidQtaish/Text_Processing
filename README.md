# NLP Pipeline (Python + NLTK)

This project demonstrates a simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline using Python and NLTK.  
It covers the following steps:

1. **Cleaning** – Lowercasing, removing punctuation/special characters.  
2. **Tokenization** – Splitting text into words.  
3. **Stemming** – Reducing words to their root forms (e.g., "running" → "run").  
4. **Lemmatization** – POS-aware word normalization using WordNet.  
5. **POS Tagging** – Part-of-Speech tagging (noun, verb, adj, etc.).  
6. **Inverted Index Creation** – Term → {document ID: [positions]}.
